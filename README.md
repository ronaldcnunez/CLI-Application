# Module One Project - Command Line Application 

## Description 
We have built a CLI discount store using Ruby that allows a user to search for items, add those items to a cart and checkout that returns the items they have purchased and their total. This app fetches discounted items available in Wal-Mart's online inventory based on the user's input. First time users are greeted with a welcome message and previous users are welcomed with a returning message.
